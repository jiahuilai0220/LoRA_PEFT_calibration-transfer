# LoRA_PEFT_calibration-transfer

  There are no large spectral datasets for model migration, and the existing publicly available model migration datasets with spectral bands that take only a small segment are more geared towards the problem of band offsets. This kind of dataset cannot reflect the capability of deep learning models. Therefore, a standard sample should be used to construct a larger dataset by testing at different models of spectrometers.
   Use the master instrument large-scale dataset to construct a robust deep learning quantitative analysis model (e.g., CNN model), and then use some of the slave instrument data to train the lora linear layer, lora convolutional layer, and lora linear layer, and compare which one is better, fine-tuning the linear layer alone or fine-tuning the convolutional layer with the linear layer at the same time. There are two strategies for merging with pre-trained models here. The first is to directly replace some layers of the original pre-trained model with lora layers, and the second is to merge the lora weights trained from the instrumentation directly with the pre-trained model. The effect of different ranks on model performance also needs to be investigated. The data from the instrument used to train the lora layer should be kept below 30 to reflect the superiority of the method.
